# Hirst Spot Painting Generator
A Python project using the Turtle module to create a colorful spot painting inspired by Damien Hirst.

## Description
This project generates a grid of randomly colored circles using the Turtle graphics library, mimicking the style of Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings. It demonstrates the use of loops, color manipulation, and Turtle drawing techniques.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Run `hirst_painting.py` in a Python environment.
3. Watch the Turtle window display the spot painting!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in standard Python library)
- colorgram module (not included in the Python Standard Library. Download from pypi.org)


## Learned Concepts
- Turtle graphics for drawing
- Nested loops for grid creation
- Random color generation using colorsys
- Coordinate system manipulation
