# Etch A Sketch Simulator
A Python project using the Turtle module to create an interactive Etch A Sketch drawing tool.

## Description
This project replicates the classic Etch A Sketch toy, allowing users to draw lines by controlling a turtle with keyboard inputs. Use arrow keys to move the turtle and create patterns, with options to clear the screen or undo movements. It showcases event-driven programming and Turtle graphics.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Run `etch_a_sketch.py` in a Python environment.
3. Use the following controls:
   - Up arrow: Move turtle forward
   - Down arrow: Move turtle backward
   - Left arrow: Turn turtle left
   - Right arrow: Turn turtle right
   - 'c' key: Clear the screen
4. Click the window to close when finished.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in standard Python library)

## Learned Concepts
- Turtle graphics for drawing
- Keyboard event handling with `onkey()`
- Screen listening with `listen()`
- Basic state management for drawing
