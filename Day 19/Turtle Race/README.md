# Turtle Race Game
A Python project using the Turtle module to create an interactive turtle racing game.

## Description
This project features a fun turtle racing game where multiple turtles of different colors compete on a track. Users can place a bet on the winning turtle's color before the race starts. The game uses random movements to determine the winner, showcasing object-oriented programming and event handling.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Run `turtle_race.py` in a Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on (e.g., red, blue, green).
   - Watch the race unfold!
4. Click the window to close when finished.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in standard Python library)
- random module (included in standard Python library)

## Learned Concepts
- Turtle graphics for animation
- Object-oriented programming with Turtle classes
- Random number generation for race outcomes
- User input handling
- Event-driven screen management
